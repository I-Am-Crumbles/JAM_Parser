#Proof of Concept for JAM-Parser:
#11:20
#While we are new to Cybersecurity, one of the first things one asks when first looking at packet captures is, "What do I do" "What do I look for?" This is where our program comes into play. The idea for our project is to create a parser to go through packet capture files.
#Manually going through pcap files can be an incredibly daunting task given the amount of information a pcap file can contain, our idea is to create a parser using Python that will go through the pcap or packet capture in order to give the Cybersec Analyst the necessary and most useful information right from the get-go.
#The main idea of JAM-Parser is to output useful five-tuple information along with counts for the different variables. We'll be doing this by running our program directly from the command line which will then display the information where the user can then create a file or where they can parse through specific information as needed. Our tool will allow user input and functionality to parse packet captures with ease and relative quickness by asking for user input.
